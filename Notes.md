# Flicks Notes

### Basic App Structure

Tab -> Nav -> (Table || Collection) -> Detail


### Models
Movie - make this an optional array in the VC, i.e., [Movies]?

### Views
- Add 'Views' group to file navigator.

### Tables
- prepareForReuse ??

### Misc
- Use standard TableView with associated VC instead of the pre-packaged TableViewController. This allows us to easily toggle between table and collection views. Just load both and toggle which is hidden.
- May need to clean and build to get Xcode to recognize new pod files.
