Video showing the network error:

![Network Error Video](flicks_network_error.gif)

I made the video with the following settings:

- I set configuration.URLCache = nil to keep NSURLSession from caching the request. Otherwise it was difficult to show the network error message.
- I used the Network Link Conditioner to reduce the bandwidth (DSL profile) so you could see the images loading and to simulate 100% data loss.

## Icons

- The tickets icon on the tab bar was created by Arthur Lac√¥te of the Noun Project [thenounproject](http://thenounproject.com).
- Some of the icons came from [iconmonstr](http://iconmonstr.com)
- Some of the icons (including the app icon) were made by me, Marc Adam Anderson.
